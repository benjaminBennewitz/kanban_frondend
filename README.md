# Kanban clone Frontend - TICKETEER

## Project Overview
The TICKETEER is a task management tool built with Angular. It allows users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks in various stages of completion, such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Done," and "Urgent." The frontend communicates with a backend service (DJANGO/ https://github.com/benjaminBennewitz/kanban_backend) to persist data and ensure that users can effectively track their work.

## Why This Project is Useful
